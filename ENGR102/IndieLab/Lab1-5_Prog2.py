"""
a. First print out a line of text at the beginning, stating what is being
shown in the following lines.
b.  Finally, print out a sequence of 7 numbers, representing evaluating
the function at 8 different values. (Notice that the evaluation gets closer and closer to -5, in this
case.)
c. Remember ‘from math import *’. We will delve into the mechanics of
this statement later in the course.

#This shows the evaluation of (1+1/x)^x evaluated close to x=?
